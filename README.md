# Kickstarter_analysis_resubmission
Louise wanted to see how close her play Fever fared against other plays in relation to their launch dates vs. funding goals. All the data used was used to determine success and failure rates, and we assisted with her understanding to see how the campaigns worked and what she would focus on to become successful with her play.

The purpose of this project was to use excel to analyze the dataset given to identify the success/fail trends using pivot tables, applying formulas and using statements such as lookup and If statements. 

Most of the work was done by using pivot tables and charts to determine the trends in success/fail.
